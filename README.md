# Special-Libraries

Initial upload so I can preserve this.

These are special libraries for Arduino and Teensy that I have modified for my needs

# TimeTeensy3
I added support for Daylight Savings time as I needed it for a project.

# JKCmdParser
The original idea for this came from a magazine article. Unfortunately I forgot where it came from. 
Possibly Servo Magazine??. 
The code has been highly modified to add lots of stuff such as floats and strings.
